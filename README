Simple script that creates some useful git aliases to make it more user friendly.
If there's any crazy git command you use, any more complicated thing you'd like to do with git but can't figure out, or something you wish git would do easier, please contribute!

As of now:

git unstage <file>  : removes changes from the index
git file-log <file> : shows all commits that have touched a file (even if  you have renamed/moved it)

To create the aliases just clone the project and run the shell script.
